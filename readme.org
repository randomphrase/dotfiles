Here are my dotfiles. Feel free to fork and/or use and/or ignore.

It's obviously tailored more towards my usage, which is [[http://spacemacs.org/][spacemacs]], [[https://github.com/tmux/tmux][tmux]] and [[http://www.zsh.org/][zsh]] with [[https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh][oh-my-zsh]].

Basic setup is:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
$ cd
$ git clone --recursive https://github.com/randomphrase/dotfiles .dotfiles
$ .dotfiles/bootstrap.sh
#+END_EXAMPLE

This will attempt to set up symlinks from ~.dotfiles/foo~ to ~.foo~. If you already have a ~.foo~, move it out of the way (or not!) and re-run ~bootstrap.sh~.
